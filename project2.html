    <h2>Urban Environments</h2>
    <p>The heterogeneous nature of urban environments means that atmospheric research ideally requires a dense network of sensors to adequately resolve the local climate. With recent advances in sensor technology, a number of urban meteorological networks now exist with a range of research or operational objectives.</p>

    <h2>Meso scale sensors</h2>
    <p>Meso-scale networks observe regional atmospheric processes and weather phenomenon such as thunderstorms and squall lines â€“ such processes are often hazardous, but cannot be adequately captured by individual monitoring stations, particularly over urban environments (Oke, 2004). Meso-scale networks potentially extend over hundreds to hundreds of thousands of square kilometres, covering both urbanized, peri-urban and rural areas.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started in UX Design</h2>
    <p>Although user experience (UX) is quite new, designing user experience is not. For as long as there have been people, there have been products; for as long as there have been products, there have been users; and for as long as there have been users, there has been user experience. In this sense, all design is user experience design.</p>
